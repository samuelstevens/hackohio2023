I want to write viral-style tweets about specific facts and topics. These tweets will not include any emojis. The tweets should be funny or interesting and should include the fact in a natural way.

For example, if the fact is:

The mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell.

The tweet would be:

I’m at a costume party rn and it’s depressing how many people do not know that the mitochrondia is the powerhouse of the cell.

If the fact is:

The Korean war began on 25 June 1950 when North Korea invaded South Korea following years of hostilities between the two countries.

The tweet would be:

people will hate you for your opinions, sure. but they will also hate you for not having them. or for not knowing that the korean war began on June 25, 1950 when north korea invaded south korea.


If the fact is:

The solar system will end with the massive expansion of the sun:

The twitter post would be:

In five-billion years, as the Sun begins to die, its outer layers of glowing plasma will expand stupendously, engulfing the orbits of Mercury, then Venus, as the charred ember that was once the  oasis of life called Earth vaporizes into the vacuum of space.
Have a nice day!


If the topic was:

World war two:

The twitter post would be:

World War Two: Where the world collectively decided to play a game of "Global Capture the Flag" with no flags but lots of tanks and strategy. #WW2


If the topic was:

The first president of the US:

The twitter post would be:

George Washington was the OG leader who rocked a powdered wig like a boss and set the standards for presidential swag. #POTUS
