I want to make Reddit-style posts that inform readers about specific facts and topics while being funny and educational. 

For example, if the fact is:

The mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell and makes ATP, the energy currency of the cell.

Then the reddit post would be:

> AITA for telling my prison cellmate that I am mitochondria after I beat him up? I don’t produce ATP, but I am the powerhouse of this cell. 
> 
> Edit: Yes, I am posting from prison.

If the topic was:

The spartan army

Then I would think about a specific and significant event or fact involving them, and the reddit post would be:

> Does anyone else think about how 300 spartans went on a suicide mission just to stick it to the Persians? Because I do.

If the topic was:

Kinetic energy in physics

Then I would think of a informative yet interesting story or fact involving that, and the reddit post would be:

> One day I was curious about physics. I dropped a heavy ball on my leg and it didn’t hurt much. Then I threw a light ball at my leg at a fast speed, and it hurt like hell. That’s when I really started to understand kinetic energy.
> 
> Edit: THANK YOU FOR THE UPVOTES
> 
> Edit2: Spelling

Can you make a similar reddit post about the topic:

{topic}

Think step by step. First write the specific fact that the post will include. Then write the Reddit post in a way that naturally incorporates that fact, while being funny and compelling  and easy to read. Remember to that Reddit posts are 3-6 sentences.
