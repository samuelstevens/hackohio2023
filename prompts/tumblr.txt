I want to write tumblr posts about specific facts and topics. These posts will not include any emojis. The posts should be funny or interesting and should include the fact in a natural way. But also get a little bit wild with it.

For example, if the fact is:

The mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell.

The post would be:

wings of fire taught me that you always need your friends

percy jackson taught me that being unique is fun

dear evan hansen taught me that you will be found

whiplash taught me to push on even though things may get hard

brooklyn nine-nine taught me to enjoy everything while it lasts, because it will end one day

bUT ABOVE ALL THANK GOD SCHOOL TAUGHT ME THAT MITOCHONDRIA IS THE POWERHOUSE OF THE CELL

If the fact is:

During the korean war, china knew very little about north korea.

The post would be:

My favourite part about the Korean War is that China had no idea that Kim Il-sung was gonna invade the south they literally just didn't tell them anything

If the fact is:

It takes 8 minutes and 18 seconds for light from the sun to reach earth.

The post would be:

IF THE SUN EXPLODED, YOU WOULDN'T KNOW UNTIL EIGHT MINUTES LATER
LIGHT FROM THE SUN REACHES THE EARTH AT 8 MINUTES AND 18 SECONDS. THIS IS THE SAME AMOUNT OF TIME IT'LL TAKE FOR US TO SEE ANY CHANGES IN THE SUN.

If the fact is:


Norns are deities from Norse mythology that shape the course of human destinies.

The Tumblr post would be:

The Norns, fate's spinners, sit by Yggdrasil's roots,
Weaving the threads of destiny, the future to produce.
Their prophesies, spoken with care, guide the lives of all,
Etched in the bark of the great tree, forever to stand tall.

With Urd, Verdandi, and Skuld, they control the fate of all,
Their spinning wheel, never still, the past, present, and future call.
With each turn of the wheel, a new fate is spun,
Guiding the lives of gods and men, till the cycle is done.

Their words, though often cryptic, hold power beyond measure,
For they hold the secrets of life and death, a timeless treasure.
So heed their words, and heed them well, for they are the keepers of fate,
And in their hands, the future rests, with Yggdrasil as its gate.

If the fact is:
Force is equal to mass times acceleration.

The Tumblr post would be:

Behold the wisdom of Sir Isaac Newton, the OG physics guru! 

In the beginning, there was a dude sitting under an apple, and he thought, 'Why do things move?â€™ â€¦ and then it hit him

And lo and behold, he came up with this epic equation: Force = Mass Ã— Acceleration. ðŸ’¥

So, the next time you wonder why stuff happens the way it does, just remember Newton and his falling apple.

If the fact is:

World War II

The response would be:

Get ready for a history lesson that's wilder than a rollercoaster ride!

World War II, folks, was the real-life 'Avengers: Endgame' of the 20th century. 

Picture this: The whole world locked in an epic battle of good vs. evil. 

On one side, you've got the Allies, the ultimate superhero squad, with the U.S., U.K., Soviet Union, and more. 

And then, the Axis Powers, the bad guys, led by the infamous supervillain, Adolf Hitler. 

It was like a worldwide game of capture the flag, with nations duking it out on every continent. 

The world saw the Blitz, D-Day, and the atomic bomb drop like real-life comic book plot twists. 

But in the end, the good guys triumphed, the bad guys got their comeuppance, and the world learned a valuable lesson: peace is precious. 

So, the next time you watch a superhero movie, remember that World War II was the ultimate showdown.
